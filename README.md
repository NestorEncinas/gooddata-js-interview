# Goog Data JS Interview

Code written by Nestor Encinas Rosa

# General Information

I re-write the code using functional components, React hooks and TypeScript

## Project Structure

Project is divided on -

- Components
- Pages
- Hooks
- Styles
- Utils

I personally like to have the differents parts of the project separated in different components, so each of them will handle some specific functionality, doing it this way is easier to keep track of the updates in case it wil become a big project, instead of having for example like 400 lines on code on some single component, that will be crazy to understand.

### Initialization

1. Create a clone of the repository
2. Run `cd gooddata-js-interview`.
3. Run `yarn install`.
4. Run `yarn start`.
5. Project should be ready on
